# STEM Confidence, Context, and Problem-Solving  
Repository for analysis code and synthetic data accompanying the manuscript:  
**“STEM Confidence, Context, and Problem-Solving” (submitted to *Learning and Instruction*)**

## Overview  
This repository contains the analysis code and supporting materials used in:  

Xiao, X., Wilson, M., Patz, R., & Cheng, Y. (2025). *STEM Confidence, Context, and Problem-Solving*. Manuscript submitted for review to *Learning and Instruction*.  

The study investigates how students’ motivational perceptions (confidence, interest, opportunity, career aspirations) predict growth in problem-solving proficiency in mathematics (PSM), and how these links vary across gender, ethnicity, and educational contexts (Middle School, Non-AP High School, AP High School).

## Contents  
- **/code/**  
  - `analysis_pipeline.R`: Main R script for data cleaning, modeling, and figures  
  - Additional helper functions and scripts as needed  

- **/data/**  
  - `synthetic_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset mirroring the structure and distribution of the original student-level data.  
  - `codebook.md`: Description of all variables, coding schemes, and scales.  

- **/docs/**  
  - Supplementary materials, including plots and tables generated during analysis.

## Data Availability  
Due to FERPA and IRB restrictions, the original student-level data cannot be shared publicly. Instead, we provide:  
- A **synthetic dataset** (`synthetic_data.csv`) with the same structure and approximate distributions.  
- A **codebook** to describe variables and coding.  

Researchers seeking access to the original de-identified dataset may contact the corresponding author, subject to IRB and data use agreements.
